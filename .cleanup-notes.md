# Cleanup Notes

## Pending Cleanup Items

### 1. fyersDataSocket.log (In Progress)
**Location:** Root directory (should be in `logs/`)
**Status:** File currently in use by a process, cannot be moved yet
**Action Required:** 
- Close any running WebSocket connections
- Delete `fyersDataSocket.log` from root directory
- Future logs will be created in `logs/` directory (already fixed in code)

**Already Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated `tests/test_websocket_token.py` - log_path="" → log_path="logs"
- ✅ Updated `tests/test_websocket_live.py` - log_path="" → log_path="logs"
- ✅ All production scripts already use log_path="logs"

**Note:** The file is already in .gitignore (*.log pattern), so it won't be committed.
